# Automated Docker Image Building with CI/CD Workflow Integration

Summary of the steps that one can take to create a Docker image  and integrate it into an existing CI/CD workflow. This guide will use GitHub Actions as the the continuous integration tool and is placed at [Github Action](https://github.com/arunp77/Job-Market-project/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Steps

1. **DockerHub account creation:** Create a account at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup). Follow on screen descriptions. Choose Personal version. Verfiy the account creation at the email you registered for. If you have already created our account, login to the DOcker Hub account. 
2. **Generate Docker Access Token:** Navigate to the account settings. Go to the "Security" section and look for the option to generate an access token (Go to `My Profile > [Edit profile] > Security > Access Tokens > New Access Token`). It will ask you Access token description. In our case, I use `Job-Market-access-token` and then gave all the read, write, delete access. Then click generate the access token.

   you must save the token at some safe place. It will be shown just once. 
3. **Setup GitHub Secrets:** Go to the Github repository. Next click settings tab and then 'Secrets and variables' (`setting > Secrets and variables > Actions`). Click on `New repository secret`. For the secret name, use `DOCKER_USERNAME` and for the secret value, paste your Docker Hub `username`. Repeat the above steps to add another secret named `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, using the Docker Hub access token as the secret value.

   Here the added secrets will be securely stored and accessible to the CI workflows in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. 

4. **Add Dockerfile:** Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory for the project. This file contains instructions for building the Docker image, including setting up the environment and dependencies and it is named as [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in the root directory. Let's explain the `Dockerfile` little bit:
    - `FROM python:3.10`: This will  create a new image based on Python version 3.10, which is currently the latest stable.
    - `WORKDIR /app`: This  sets the working directory of our container to `/app`, which is where weâ€™ll put our application.
    - `COPY . /app`: This line copies the contents of the current directory  (where the Dockerfile is located) into `/app` directory inside the container. Here `.` represents the current directory, and `/app` is the destination directory inside the container. 
    -  `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`: this line install all the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip` where pip will not cache downloaded packages, which save disk space in the resulting Docker image.
    - `CMD ["python", "scripts/etl/etl_script.py"]`: line specifies the default command to run when container starts. It runs the python script `etl_scripts.py` relative to the working directory `/app`. This command will be executed automatically when a container based on the image is launched, unless overridden by specifying a different command at runtime. (Later we will create a `Application` with `setup.py` in the home directory where  we will call all functions).

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Here `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file can access ad use secrets using `{{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`                      |
| syntax. When secrets are used in a workflow, their values are masked in the logs to prevent accidental exposure.      |

5. After including the Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`, completing the aforementioned steps,  the updates are pushed to the GitHub repository. This triggers the automatic generation and upload of Docker images directly to Docker Hub. You can access these Docker images here: [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arunp77/job_market/general). This streamlined process ensures that all files are kept up-to-date in the GitHub repository, while Docker images are seamlessly created.

6. In the `ci.yml` the following code snippet is added to enable access to Docker credentials and subsequently create and push Docker images to Docker Hub. The snippet is placed inside the `jobs` and steps::
   
   ```yaml
   - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t arunp77/job_market:latest .

    - name: Push Docker image
      run: |
         echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
         docker push arunp77/job_market:latest
   ```

    This workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch, checks out the repository, logs in to Docker Hub using secrets for the Docker Hub username and password, builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the repository's root directory, and finally, pushes the built Docker image to the Docker Hub repository.

7. **Creating a docker image directly into the Docker hub**:  
   - To build the docker image, navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal and run
    ```bash
    docker build -t arunp77/job_market:latest .
    ```
   (Here tag `latest` in the repo arunp77/job-market is added.)

   It is to be  noted that, if there are any changes in this file then a new image should be built using above command. Also you should remember that you may be asked to install the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

   - To push the image:

        ```bash
        docker push arunp77/job_market:latest
        ```
