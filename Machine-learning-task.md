# Machine Learning Analysis for Job Postings in Germany

We can perform the following tasks:

## 1. Job Title Classification
- **Task**: Classify job titles into predefined categories or clusters based on their descriptions or titles.
- **Algorithms**: Text Classification (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests)

## 2. Location-based Analysis
- **Task**: Analyze trends and patterns based on job postings' locations.
- **Algorithms**: Geographic Clustering (K-Means clustering??????)

## 3. Job Posting Frequency Prediction
- **Task**: Predict the frequency of job postings based on different features like company, job title, location, etc.
- **Algorithms** 
  - Time Series Forecasting: ??? ( I don't know which model but thinking of the ARMIA model)
  - Regression: Linear Regression

## 4. Experience Level Prediction
- **Task**: Predict the experience level required for a job posting based on features like job title, description, etc.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Multiclass Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees

Other than these, I am also thinking about the following tasks that we can look at. But these will be for our future work. 
## 1. Job Recommendation
- **Task**: Recommend jobs to users based on their preferences, skills, or past interactions.
- **Algorithms**: ???

## 2. Feature Importance Analysis
- **Task**: Identify the most important features that influence job posting characteristics like job title, location, etc.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Random Forests: Feature importances analysis.
  - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Logistic Regression with RFE.
