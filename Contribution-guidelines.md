# Contribution Guidlines

Here are the next steps for contributing to the project:

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arunp77/Job-Market-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Job-Market-Project
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name for the branch that reflects the purpose of your changes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
   For example:
   - Khusboo can create a branch: <pre>git checkout -b khusboo-branch</pre>
   - Brindha can create a branch: <pre>git checkout -b Brindha-branch</pre>
   - Arun can create a branch: <pre>git checkout -b Arun-branch</pre>

5. **Make Changes**: Make your desired changes to the project. This may include adding new features, fixing bugs, updating documentation, or optimizing code.

6. **Commit Changes**: Once you've made your changes, commit them to your branch with a clear and concise commit message. It's good practice to keep each commit focused on a single change.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of the changes"
   ```
   If you want to give a title to the commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Title for the commit" -m "Brief description of the changes"
   ```

8. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

9. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the GitHub repository page or directly from your code editor (such as VSCODE or git terminal) and open a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.
   - Ensure your pull request title is descriptive and summarizes the changes.
   - Reference any related issues or pull requests in your description using keywords like "Closes #issue-number" or "Fixes #issue-number" to automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.
   - Request reviewers if necessary by mentioning them in the pull request description.

10. **Review and Address Feedback**: We can discuss this at any time for further review of the project status or any other related things.

11. **Merge Pull Request**: Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main branch of the repository by a project maintainer.

12. **Stay Updated**: Keep your local repository up to date with the changes in the main repository. Periodically fetch the latest changes from the main repository and rebase your branch if necessary to resolve any conflicts.
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/main
    ```
