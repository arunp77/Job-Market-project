## Contribution Guidelines

3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name for the branch that reflects the purpose of your changes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Make your desired changes to the project. This may include adding new features, fixing bugs, updating documentation, or optimizing code.

5. **Commit Changes**: Once you've made your changes, commit them to your branch with a clear and concise commit message. It's good practice to keep each commit focused on a single change.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of the changes"
   ```

6. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the GitHub repository page and open a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.
   - Ensure your pull request title is descriptive and summarizes the changes.
   - Reference any related issues or pull requests in your description using keywords like "Closes #issue-number" or "Fixes #issue-number" to automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.
   - Request reviewers if necessary by mentioning them in the pull request description.

8. **Review and Address Feedback**: Collaborate with other contributors and address any feedback or suggestions provided during the review process. Make necessary revisions to your code as requested.

9. **Merge Pull Request**: Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main branch of the repository by a project maintainer.

10. **Stay Updated**: Keep your local repository up to date with the changes in the main repository. Periodically fetch the latest changes from the main repository and rebase your branch if necessary to resolve any conflicts.
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/main
    ```
